# Hackathon Project - EmeraldAI

Emerald AI is a public Discord bot that includes:
- Moderation commands
- Utility commands
- Discord games
- Image generation AI
- Text generation AI

# Inspiration

Our goal is to make artificial intelligence technology open and available to everyone, and making technology accessible. 

# How It's Built

Majority of the bot was built with the Discord.py Discord bot integration. This includes the moderation, utilities, and game commands. The artificial intelligence part of the bot is built with the Discord.js Discord bot integration. The AI uses Ollama's LLaVA model, which supports text generation and image generation (stable diffusion)

# Challenges Faced
Throughout this project, we faced many challenges, including:
- Integrating a Discord bot that's built with both Discord.py and Discord.js
- Getting the API and calling the pretrained LLaVA model
- Making the bot generate text and image faster, without a lot of lag

# Lessons Learned
During this project we have learned many lessons on both teamwork, programming, and artificial intelligence. We needed to have good communication throughout the team to make sure the project was streamlined, good planning to make sure the project wasn't messy, and consistent compromising throughout the projects when disagreements came up. We also learned how to successfully integrate outside APIs and AI models into the Discord bot, along with the general framework of Discord.py.
